title: Collecting Data
description: Introduction to the collect phase
introHeader: collect
---

Every support bundle or preflight check starts with a collect phase.
During this time, information is collected from the cluster, the environment, the application and other sources to be used later in the analysis or preflight results.

When designing a support bundle or preflight check, be sure to add all necessary data to the collectors.
The [analyze phase](/analyze/) can only use the output of the collect phase to perform analysis and provide results, however a large set of collectors are included automatically.

## Including Collectors

To specify the data to include for later phases, the collect phase accepts a Kubernetes custom resource as defined here.
A [full reference of the collectors](/collect/collectors/) is also available.

Collectors are specified inside either a Preflight, HostPreflight or a SupportBundle YAML file. To build a set of collectors, start with a Kubernetes YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: Preflight
metadata:
  name: my-application-name
spec:
  collectors: []
```

or

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: HostPreflight
metadata:
  name: my-application-name
spec:
  collectors: []
  remoteCollectors: []
```

or

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: SupportBundle
metadata:
  name: my-application-name
spec:
  collectors: []
```


The above files are simple, but valid sets of collectors.
It will collect only the default data.

To add additional collectors, specify each one in the `collectors` array.
Each collector can be included multiple times, if there are different sets of options to use.

For example, a complete spec might be:

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: SupportBundle
metadata:
  name: my-application-name
spec:
  collectors:
    - clusterInfo: {}
    - clusterResources: {}
    - logs:
        selector:
          - app=api
        namespace: default
        limits:
          maxAge: 720h
          maxLines: 1000
    - http:
        name: healthz
        get:
          url: http://api:3000/healthz
    - exec:
        name: mysql-version
        selector:
          - app=mysql
        namespace: default
        command: ["mysql"]
        args: ["-V"]
        timeout: 5s
```

## Host Collectors

The default collectors are intended to gather information using the Kubernetes
API or from other remote services.

Host Collectors can provide more detailed information about nodes than what the
Kubernetes API provides.  Troubleshoot achieves this by running host collectors
on nodes directly. Host collectors can be used to list a node's kernel modules
or perform network connectivity checks.

Host Collectors can only be run using the `HostPreflight` Kind.  They can be
specified in either the `collectors` or `remoteCollectors` arrays.

When specified in the `collectors` array they are only run on the local host.
This is useful is you are running preflight checks by logging on to each host.

When a Host Collector is specified in the `remoteCollectors` array, it will be
run on all available Kubernetes nodes.  The list of nodes can be filtered using
a [nodeSelector](https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector).

For example, a complete spec might be:

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: HostPreflight
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  remoteCollectors:
    - blockDevices: {}
    - certificate:
        certificatePath: /etc/ssl/corp.crt
        keyPath: /etc/ssl/corp.key
    - cpu: {}
    - diskUsage:
        collectorName: ephemeral
        path: /var/lib/kubelet
    - filesystemPerformance:
        collectorName: etcd-perf
        directory: /var/lib/etcd
        fileSize: 22Mi
        operationSizeBytes: 2300
        datasync: true
    - httpLoadBalancer:
        collectorName: httploadbalancer
        port: 80
        address: http://app.corporate.internal
        timeout: 10s
    - http:
        collectorName: registry
        get:
          url: https://registry.replicated.com
    - ipv4Interfaces: {}
    - kernelModules: {}    
    - memory: {}
    - time: {}
    - tcpConnect:
        collectorName: weave host 1
        address: 10.128.0.2:6783
        timeout: 2s
    - tcpLoadBalancer:
        collectorName: LB1
        address: 10.128.0.20:6443
        port: 6443
        timeout: 5000ms
    - tcpPortStatus:
        collectorName: k8s
        port: 6443
```

Host collectors are intended to be used with Analyzers.
